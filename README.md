# OctoPrint-EEPROM-Malyan-STM32F401

This plugin is designed to get, change and save the values in the EEPROM of your Malyan or Monoprice STM32F401 Based 3D Printer.
This should include the 'GigDigit Mainboard - Select Mini V1 & V2 - "New Quiet" Version', Malyan M320, Malyan MA10, Malyan MA10 Mini, Monoprice MP10, or Monoprice MP10 Mini.

There are some missing fields such as M851, M907, and probably some others but they will be added soon. Little to no testing has been done using this plugin. Use this plugin at your own risk.
